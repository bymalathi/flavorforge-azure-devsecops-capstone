# 🍽️ FlavorForge Backend

The **FlavorForge Backend** is a RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It serves as the backend service for the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone Project by handling client requests, providing recipe data, exposing health monitoring endpoints, and supporting communication with the frontend application.

The application follows a modular and layered architecture to improve maintainability, scalability, and code organization. The current implementation uses sample in-memory data and is structured to support future enhancements such as database integration, authentication, logging, and monitoring.

---

# 🎯 Purpose

The backend is responsible for:

- Exposing REST API endpoints
- Processing client requests
- Providing recipe data
- Monitoring application health
- Managing application configuration
- Supporting frontend communication
- Serving as the business logic layer of the FlavorForge application

# 🏛️ Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture where each layer has a single responsibility.

```text
Client Request
      │
      ▼
Express Server
      │
      ▼
Controller
      │
      ▼
Service
      │
      ▼
Business Logic
      │
      ▼
JSON Response
```

### Controller Layer

The controller layer is responsible for:

- Receiving client requests
- Calling the appropriate service
- Processing request data
- Returning HTTP responses

Current controller:

- Health Controller

---

### Service Layer

The service layer contains the application's business logic.

Responsibilities include:

- Processing application data
- Preparing API responses
- Keeping controllers lightweight
- Supporting future database integration

Current service:

- Health Service

---

### Configuration Layer

Application configuration is centralized in:

```text
src/config/app.config.js
```

Current configuration includes:

- Application Name
- Application Version
- Environment
- Port
- Build Version

This approach allows different configurations for Development, QA, and Production environments without changing the application source code.

---

# 🌐 REST API Endpoints

The backend exposes REST APIs that are consumed by the React frontend.

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                       |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/health`  | Returns application health status |
| GET    | `/api/recipes` | Returns available recipes         |

---

## Sample Health Response

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "application": "FlavorForge Backend",
  "version": "1.3",
  "environment": "development",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-30T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## Sample Recipe Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Paneer Butter Masala",
    "category": "Indian"
  }
]
```

> **Note:** Recipe data is currently stored in memory and is intended for demonstration purposes. The project structure supports future integration with a persistent database.

---

# ⚙️ Environment Configuration

The backend uses **dotenv** to load configuration values from environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory.

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
APP_NAME=FlavorForge Backend
APP_VERSION=1.3
BUILD_VERSION=1.3
```

The application configuration is loaded through:

```text
src/config/app.config.js
```

Using environment variables makes it easier to deploy the application across multiple environments while keeping configuration separate from the application code.

---

# ▶️ Running the Application

## Prerequisites

Before running the backend, ensure the following software is installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- Git

The frontend application can be started separately to consume the backend APIs.

---

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## Start the Development Server

Run the backend using Nodemon.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Start the Production Server

Run the application in production mode.

```bash
npm start
```

---

# 📜 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server using Nodemon |
| `npm start` | Start the production server |
| `npm test` | Execute backend unit tests |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate code coverage report *(if configured)* |

---

# 🧪 Testing the API

Verify that the backend is running successfully.

### Browser

Open the following URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

---

### Using cURL

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

---

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
