# 📘 FlavorForge Engineering Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This guide documents the complete engineering journey of building the **FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone Project** from scratch.

Unlike the main project documentation, which focuses on the final solution, this guide explains **how the project was built step by step**, including the decisions made, prerequisites, commands executed, issues encountered, troubleshooting performed, and lessons learned throughout the implementation.

The goal is simple:

> **Anyone should be able to clone this repository, follow these documents from the beginning, and reproduce the complete project without requiring additional guidance.**

This guide is also intended to help future contributors, recruiters, interviewers, and even my future self understand not only **what was built**, but also **why it was built that way**.

# 🎯 Objectives

This implementation guide documents:

* The complete development lifecycle of FlavorForge
* The reasoning behind every major technical decision
* Prerequisites required before each phase
* Folder and file creation sequence
* Commands executed during implementation
* Expected outputs and verification steps
* Problems encountered and their resolutions
* Architecture evolution throughout the project
* Enterprise DevOps practices applied
* Lessons learned during implementation

Rather than presenting only the final working solution, this guide captures the complete engineering process.

# 👥 Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is useful for:

* Students learning Azure DevOps and Kubernetes
* DevOps engineers building similar projects
* Recruiters reviewing the implementation depth
* Interviewers understanding the engineering process
* Contributors extending the project
* Anyone who wants to recreate the project from scratch
* My future self when revisiting the project months later

# 📚 How to Use This Guide

The documents inside this folder are written in the exact order in which the project was developed.

It is recommended to read them sequentially.

Each document explains:

* Why this phase was required
* What prerequisites were needed
* What was implemented
* Commands that were executed
* Expected results
* Common issues
* Troubleshooting performed
* Verification steps
* Learning outcomes

# 📝 Documentation Format

Every implementation document follows a consistent structure.

```text
1. Goal

2. Why this phase?

3. Prerequisites

4. Folder/File Structure

5. Commands Executed

6. Expected Output

7. Verification

8. Problems Encountered

9. Root Cause

# 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

This guide follows one important principle:

> **Do not document only what worked. Document the complete engineering journey, including mistakes, troubleshooting, and the reasoning behind technical decisions.**

Understanding why a solution was chosen is often more valuable than simply seeing the final command.

---

# 🚀 Final Outcome
