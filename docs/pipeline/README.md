# Azure DevOps Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the Azure DevOps CI/CD documentation for the **FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone Project**.

The documentation is intentionally divided into two guides because they serve different purposes.

- **azure-devops-setup.md** explains **how to configure Azure DevOps** from scratch.
- **azure-devops-pipeline.md** explains **how the CI/CD pipeline works** after it has been configured.

This separation makes it easier for developers to recreate the project while also providing reviewers and interviewers with a clear explanation of the pipeline architecture and workflow.

# Summary

The Azure DevOps documentation is separated into two complementary guides:

- **azure-devops-setup.md** focuses on recreating the Azure DevOps configuration.
- **azure-devops-pipeline.md** focuses on understanding the CI/CD pipeline architecture, stages, and deployment workflow.

Together, these documents provide both the implementation steps and the architectural understanding required to recreate, maintain, and explain the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline.
