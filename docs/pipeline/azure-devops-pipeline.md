        │
        ▼
Synchronize using Argo CD
        │
        ▼
Verify Application Deployment
```

Each stage depends on the successful completion of the previous stage, ensuring that only validated and secure application versions are deployed.

---

# Stage 1: Source Checkout

## Purpose

Retrieve the latest application source code from the GitHub repository.

## Activities

- Checkout application source code
- Prepare build environment
- Configure pipeline variables

Example:

```yaml
- checkout: self
```

The pipeline always works with the latest committed code from the main branch.

---

# Stage 2: Dependency Installation

## Purpose

Install all application dependencies required for building and testing.

The pipeline installs dependencies separately for frontend and backend applications.

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This ensures both application layers are validated independently.

---

# Stage 3: Automated Testing

## Purpose

Validate application functionality before creating deployment artifacts.

The pipeline executes automated tests for:

- Backend API services
- Frontend React components
- API client functionality

---

## Backend Testing

Framework:

- Jest
- Supertest

Command:

```bash
npm test
```

Validation includes:

- API endpoint testing
- Controller validation
- Service layer verification
- Code coverage generation

Coverage reports are generated for quality analysis.

---

## Frontend Testing

Framework:

- Vitest
- React Testing Library

Validation includes:

- Component rendering
- User interface behaviour
- API client functionality

Command:

```bash
npm test
```

---

# Stage 4: Code Quality Analysis

## Purpose

Ensure maintainable and reliable code using static analysis.

Tool:

- SonarCloud

The pipeline performs:

- Source code analysis
- Code smell detection
- Duplicate code detection
- Security issue identification
- Maintainability analysis
- Coverage reporting

Pipeline flow:

```text
Source Code
      │
      ▼
SonarCloud Scanner
      │
      ▼
Quality Gate
      │
      ▼
Pipeline Decision
```

If the quality gate fails, the pipeline can prevent further deployment stages.

---

# Stage 5: Security Validation

## Purpose

Identify security vulnerabilities before container deployment.

Security checks include:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Configuration validation

Tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| npm audit | Dependency security analysis |
| Trivy | Container vulnerability scanning |
| SonarCloud | Code security analysis |

---

# DevSecOps Approach

Security is integrated throughout the delivery lifecycle.

```text
Plan
 │
 ▼
Code
 │
 ▼

 │
 ▼
Test
 │
 ▼
Scan
 │
 ▼
Deploy
 │
 ▼
Monitor
```

Security checks are automated instead of being performed only before release.

---

---

# 🐳 Stage 6: Docker Image Build

## Purpose

Create production-ready container images for the frontend and backend applications.

The pipeline builds separate Docker images:

- FlavorForge Backend
- FlavorForge Frontend

---

## Backend Image

The backend image packages:

- Node.js runtime
- Express application
- Application dependencies
- Production server configuration

Build command:

```bash
docker build \
  -t flavorforge-backend:${BUILD_BUILDID} \
  ./backend
```

---

## Frontend Image

The frontend image uses a multi-stage Docker build.

Build process:

```text
React Source Code
        │
        ▼
Node.js Build Stage
        │
        ▼
Production Build
        │
        ▼
Nginx Runtime Image
```

Build command:

```bash
docker build \
  -t flavorforge-frontend:${BUILD_BUILDID} \
  ./frontend
```

---

# 📦 Stage 7: Push Images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

## Purpose

Store validated Docker images in Azure Container Registry for Kubernetes deployment.

Registry:

```text
Azure Container Registry (ACR)
```

Pipeline workflow:

```text
Docker Image
      │
      ▼
ACR Authentication
      │
      ▼
Image Tagging
      │
      ▼
Push Image
      │
      ▼
Available for AKS
```

---

## Image Tagging Strategy

Images are tagged using the pipeline build ID.

Example:

```text
flavorforge-backend:Build-123
flavorforge-frontend:Build-123
```

Benefits:

- Version tracking
- Easy rollback
- Traceability between code and deployment

---

# 🔐 Azure Service Connections

The pipeline uses Azure DevOps Service Connections for secure authentication.

Configured connections:

| Service Connection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Azure Resource Manager Connection | Azure resource access |
| Azure Container Registry Connection | Docker image push |
| SonarCloud Connection | Code quality analysis |

Service connections avoid storing credentials inside pipeline YAML files.

---

# ☸️ Stage 8: Kubernetes Deployment

## Purpose

Deploy the application containers into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Deployment objects:

- Namespace
- Backend Deployment
- Frontend Deployment
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Ingress
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

---

# Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

The pipeline uses Kustomize for environment-specific deployments.

Available environments:

```
dev
qa
prod
```

Directory structure:

```text
kubernetes/
│
├── base/
│
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/
    ├── qa/
    └── prod/
```

---

## Deployment Command

Example:

```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/dev
```

The selected overlay combines:

```text
Base Kubernetes Resources
            +
Environment Specific Changes
            =
Final Deployment Manifest
```

---

# Rolling Update Strategy

Kubernetes performs rolling updates during deployment.

Benefits:

- Zero downtime deployment
- Gradual pod replacement
- Automatic health checking
- Easy rollback capability

Deployment flow:

```text
Old Pods Running
        │
        ▼
New Image Deployment
        │
        ▼
New Pods Created
        │
        ▼
Health Checks Passed
        │
        ▼
Old Pods Removed
```

---

# Stage 9: Deployment Verification

After deployment, the pipeline validates application health.

Verification includes:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n flavorforge
```

```bash
kubectl get services -n flavorforge
```

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n flavorforge
```

Application availability is verified after deployment completion.


---

# 🔄 GitOps Integration with Argo CD

## Purpose

The final deployment stage follows a GitOps approach using Argo CD.

Instead of directly managing Kubernetes changes manually, the desired application state is stored in Git and synchronized automatically with the AKS cluster.

---
