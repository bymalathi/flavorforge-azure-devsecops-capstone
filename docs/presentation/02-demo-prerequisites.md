# Demo Prerequisites

## Purpose

Before presenting the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone Project, it is important to verify that the demonstration environment is healthy, accessible, and ready for use.

This document provides a step-by-step pre-demo checklist to validate the local environment, Azure resources, Kubernetes cluster, CI/CD pipeline, GitOps deployment, and application availability. Performing these checks before every presentation helps ensure a smooth and reliable demonstration.

- Confirm Azure authentication and resource availability.
- Validate Azure Container Registry (ACR) access.
- Ensure the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster is healthy.
- Verify Kubernetes workloads, services, and ingress.
- Confirm successful Azure DevOps pipeline execution.
- Verify Argo CD synchronization and application health.
- Test frontend and backend application availability.
- Ensure the complete demonstration environment is ready.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the verification process, ensure that you have:

- Azure CLI installed and authenticated.
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed.
- `kubectl` configured to access the AKS cluster.
- Access to the Azure DevOps project.
