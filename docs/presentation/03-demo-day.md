## Talking Points

Explain that:

- Git is the single source of truth.
- Argo CD continuously monitors the repository.
- Any approved change is automatically synchronized.
- Drift between Git and the cluster is detected.
- Applications can automatically recover to the desired state.

### Live Verification

Run:

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

Explain the meaning of:

- **Synced** – The cluster matches the Git repository.
- **Healthy** – The application is running correctly.

### Evidence

# 11. Incident Demonstration

**Duration:** 4 Minutes

## Objective

Show how Kubernetes and GitOps improve operational reliability by recovering from common failures.

## Demonstration Options

Choose one safe scenario during the presentation.

### Scenario 1 – Delete a Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n flavorforge
```

Explain that Kubernetes automatically creates a replacement pod to maintain the desired state.

---

### Scenario 2 – GitOps Drift

Scale the backend deployment manually.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment backend \
--replicas=1 \
-n flavorforge
```
