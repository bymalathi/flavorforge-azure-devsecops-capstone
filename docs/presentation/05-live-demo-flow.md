# Live Demo Flow

## Purpose

This document provides a step-by-step guide for demonstrating the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone Project during technical presentations, internship evaluations, and DevOps interviews.

The demo follows the same journey as a modern software delivery lifecycle—from verifying the environment to demonstrating the application, CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes deployment, GitOps, and operational resilience.

# Step 1 – Verify Azure Environment

## Objective

Confirm that the demonstration environment is connected to the correct Azure subscription.

### Command

```bash
az account show
```

### Expected Result

Verify:

- Subscription Name
- Subscription ID
- Tenant ID

### Evidence

---

# Step 2 – Verify AKS Cluster

## Objective

Confirm that the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster is healthy.

### Command

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Expected Result

- All nodes should be in the **Ready** state.

### Evidence

![AKS Nodes](/screenshots/Azure/28-kubectl%20get%20nodes.png)

*Figure 4.2 – AKS worker nodes are ready.*

---

# Step 3 – Verify Kubernetes Resources

## Objective

Confirm that all application resources are running successfully.

### Command

```bash
kubectl get all -n flavorforge
```

### Expected Result

Verify that:

- Deployments are available.
- Pods are running.
- Services are created.
- ReplicaSets are healthy.

### Evidence

![Kubernetes Resources](/screenshots/Kubernetes/kubectl%20get%20all%20-n%20flavorforge.png)

*Figure 4.3 – FlavorForge resources running inside the Kubernetes cluster.*

---

# Step 4 – Verify Application

## Objective

Demonstrate that the frontend application is accessible.

### Action

Open the application URL in the browser.

Walk through:

- Home page
- Recipe listing
- Search functionality
- Category filtering
- Responsive user interface

### Evidence

![FlavorForge Home Page](/screenshots/Kubernetes/Frontend%20in%20the%20browser%20-%20http-104.45.175.93.png)

*Figure 4.4 – FlavorForge frontend running successfully.*

---

# Step 5 – Verify Backend API

## Objective

Confirm that the backend service is running and responding correctly.

### Command

```bash
curl http://<APPLICATION-IP>/api/health
```

> Replace `<APPLICATION-IP>` with the public IP or DNS name of your application.

### Expected Result

The API should return a successful health response similar to:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "service": "FlavorForge Backend",
  "version": "1.3"
}
```

### Talking Points

Explain that this endpoint is used for:

- Application health verification
- Kubernetes readiness checks
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting

### Evidence

![Backend Health](/screenshots/Backend/curl.png)

*Figure 4.5 – Backend health endpoint responding successfully.*

---

# Step 6 – Explain Docker Containers

## Objective

Explain how the application is packaged before deployment.

### Talking Points

Explain that:

- Frontend and Backend are packaged separately.
- Docker ensures consistent execution across environments.
- Images are built automatically during the CI/CD pipeline.
- Containers eliminate "It works on my machine" issues.

### Evidence

![Docker Containers](/screenshots/Docker/10-frontend-backend-container-running.png)

*Figure 4.6 – Frontend and Backend running as Docker containers.*

---

# Step 7 – Verify Azure Container Registry (ACR)

## Objective

Demonstrate where the container images are stored.

### Action

Open Azure Portal.

Navigate to:

```
Azure Portal
    ↓
Container Registry
    ↓
Repositories
```

Show:

- Backend Image
- Frontend Image
- Latest Tags

### Talking Points

Explain that:

- The pipeline pushes images automatically.
- AKS pulls images directly from ACR.
- ACR acts as the trusted image repository.

### Evidence

![Azure Container Registry](/screenshots/Azure/25-ACR-images.png)

*Figure 4.7 – Container images stored in Azure Container Registry.*

---

# Step 8 – Explain Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Objective

Explain where the application is running.

### Action

Open:

Azure Portal → Kubernetes Services

Explain:

- Managed Kubernetes
- Worker Nodes
- Deployments
- Networking
- Load Balancer

### Evidence

![AKS Cluster](/screenshots/Azure/27-aks-cluster-running.png)

*Figure 4.8 – Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.*

---

# Step 9 – Demonstrate Azure DevOps Pipeline

## Objective

Show how application delivery is fully automated.

### Action

Open Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Walk through the completed pipeline.

Explain each stage:

1. Build
2. Test
3. SonarCloud Analysis
4. Docker Build
5. Trivy Scan
6. Push to ACR
7. Deploy to AKS

### Talking Points

Highlight that:

- Every deployment follows the same workflow.
- Automation reduces manual errors.
- Quality and security checks happen before deployment.

### Evidence

![Azure DevOps Pipeline](/screenshots/Pipeline/6-Pipelines-Run.png)

*Figure 4.9 – Successful Azure DevOps pipeline execution.*

---

# Step 10 – Demonstrate Code Quality

## Objective

Show how code quality is verified before deployment.

### Talking Points

Explain that SonarCloud checks:

- Code smells
- Bugs
- Maintainability
- Reliability
- Test coverage

Quality Gates help prevent low-quality code from progressing through the pipeline.

### Evidence

![Code Coverage](/screenshots/Enterprise%20Azure%20DevOps%20Release%20Simulation/16-code%20coverage.png)

*Figure 4.10 – SonarCloud quality analysis.*

---

# Step 11 – Demonstrate GitOps

## Objective

Show that Git is the single source of truth.

### Command

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

### Expected Result

The application should display:

- Healthy
- Synced

### Talking Points

Explain that:

- Argo CD continuously watches the Git repository.
- Any approved change is synchronized automatically.
- Configuration drift is detected and corrected.

### Evidence

![Argo CD](/screenshots/argo-cd/4-flavorforge-Application-Details-Tree-Argo-CD.png)

*Figure 4.11 – Argo CD application status.*

---

# Step 12 – Demonstrate Kubernetes Self-Healing

## Objective

Show how Kubernetes automatically recovers from failures.

### Command

```bash
kubectl get pods -n flavorforge

kubectl delete pod <backend-pod-name> -n flavorforge
```

### Expected Result

Observe that:

- The selected pod is terminated.
- Kubernetes automatically creates a replacement pod.
- Application availability is maintained.

### Talking Points

Explain that:

- The Deployment controller continuously monitors the desired state.
- Kubernetes automatically restores missing replicas.
- This demonstrates platform resilience.
