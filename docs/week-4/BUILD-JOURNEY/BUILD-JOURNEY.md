# FlavorForge Build Journey

## 1. Purpose

This document provides the complete chronological journey for rebuilding the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone project from an empty Git repository.

Unlike the implementation guides, this document focuses on the order in which the project was designed, built, verified, and deployed. Every phase documents the objectives, prerequisites, implementation steps, verification process, supporting evidence, common issues, and completion criteria required before progressing to the next phase.

The goal is to ensure that the project can be recreated consistently months or years later without relying on memory or external notes.

---

## 2. Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

- Developers rebuilding the project from scratch.
- Students learning Azure DevSecOps implementation.
- Reviewers and interviewers who want to understand the complete engineering journey.
- Future maintenance of the FlavorForge project.

---

## 3. Project Overview

FlavorForge is a cloud-native recipe discovery application built using a modern DevSecOps workflow.

The application consists of a React frontend, a Node.js and Express backend, Docker containers, Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Kubernetes manifests, Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines, SonarCloud quality analysis, Trivy security scanning, and Argo CD GitOps deployment.

The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of designing, building, testing, securing, deploying, and maintaining a cloud-native application using Microsoft Azure and Kubernetes.

---

## 4. Build Strategy

The project is rebuilt in the same sequence in which it was originally developed.

Each phase depends on the successful completion of the previous phase. Verification is performed before moving to the next stage to ensure that every component is functioning correctly.

The build sequence is summarized below.

# Phase 1 — Project Planning

## Goal

Define the project vision, technology stack, architecture, development approach, and expected deliverables before writing any code.

Proper planning reduces rework, establishes a clear implementation roadmap, and ensures that every subsequent phase follows a well-defined architecture.

---

## Why This Phase Comes First

Every software project begins with planning.

Before creating a repository or writing code, the project requirements, architecture, technologies, and deployment strategy must be identified.

Planning first ensures that development decisions remain consistent throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Concept

Building a software project is similar to constructing a house.

A house is not built by purchasing bricks first. The land is surveyed, the requirements are gathered, the architecture is designed, and a construction plan is approved before construction begins.

Similarly, FlavorForge is planned before any source code, infrastructure, or deployment resources are created.

---

## Technical Explanation

During this phase, the overall architecture of the application is defined, the technology stack is selected, and the complete DevSecOps workflow is planned.

No application code or cloud resources are created during this phase.

Instead, this phase establishes the blueprint that guides every remaining stage of the project.

---

## Prerequisites

None.

This is the starting point for rebuilding the project.

---

## Files Created

No project files are created during this phase.

The planning process produces design decisions that will be implemented during the following phases.

---

## Files Modified

None.

---

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Containerization | Docker |
| Container Registry | Azure Container Registry (ACR) |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes |
| Managed Kubernetes | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) |
| CI/CD | Azure DevOps Pipelines |
| Code Quality | SonarCloud |
| Security Scanning | Trivy |
| GitOps | Argo CD |
| Version Control | Git and GitHub |

---

## Project Objectives

The project should:

- Build a modern React frontend.
- Develop a RESTful backend using Node.js and Express.
- Containerize both applications using Docker.
- Store container images in Azure Container Registry.
- Deploy workloads to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Manage Kubernetes resources using Kustomize overlays.
- Automate CI/CD using Azure DevOps.
- Perform code quality analysis using SonarCloud.
- Scan container images using Trivy.
- Implement GitOps deployments using Argo CD.
- Produce comprehensive engineering documentation.
- Demonstrate the complete DevSecOps lifecycle.

---

## Step-by-Step Tasks

1. Define the application idea.
2. Identify project requirements.
3. Select the frontend framework.
4. Select the backend framework.
5. Select the cloud platform.
6. Select the container platform.
7. Select the CI/CD platform.
8. Define the deployment strategy.
9. Define the documentation strategy.
10. Define the project directory structure.

No implementation commands are executed during this phase.

---

## Verification

Planning is complete when:

- Project objectives are clearly documented.
- Technology stack has been finalized.
- Overall architecture has been identified.
- Build sequence has been established.
- Development roadmap has been approved.

---

## Evidence

Use the following architecture diagrams from the repository.

*Figure 1.1 – Overall enterprise cloud architecture.*



![Application Architecture](/docs/diagrams/flavorforge-application-architecture.png)

*Figure 1.2 – FlavorForge application architecture.*

![DevSecOps Lifecycle](/docs/diagrams/flavorforge-devsecops-lifecycle-infographic.png)

*Figure 1.3 – FlavorForge DevSecOps lifecycle.*

---

## Common Mistakes

- Beginning development before defining the architecture.
- Choosing technologies without understanding how they integrate.
- Building infrastructure before designing the deployment workflow.
- Creating project folders without a planned repository structure.
- Failing to define verification criteria before implementation begins.

---

## Before Moving to Phase 2

Verify that:

- Project vision is finalized.
- Technology stack has been selected.
- Build sequence has been documented.
- Overall architecture is understood.
- Development roadmap is complete.

Only after these activities are completed should the repository be created.

# Phase 2 — Development Environment Setup

## Goal

Prepare a development workstation with all required software, command-line tools, and editors needed to build, test, containerize, deploy, and maintain the FlavorForge application.

A correctly configured development environment ensures that every subsequent phase can be completed without missing dependencies or compatibility issues.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

Before creating a repository or writing application code, the development environment must be prepared.

Installing all required tools at the beginning prevents interruptions during later phases and ensures that the same environment is used throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Concept

Building a software project requires more than writing code.

A developer also needs the correct tools to create source code, manage versions, build containers, communicate with Azure, deploy Kubernetes resources, and automate deployments.

This phase prepares the workstation so that it is capable of performing every task required throughout the project.

---

## Technical Explanation

The FlavorForge project depends on several development tools, including Git, Node.js, Docker, Azure CLI, Kubernetes CLI utilities, and Visual Studio Code.

Each tool has a specific responsibility during development.

Installing and verifying these tools before beginning development reduces configuration issues and simplifies troubleshooting.

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Phase 1 – Project Planning.
- Internet connectivity.
- Administrative or sudo privileges on the development machine.

---

## Files Created

No project source files are created during this phase.

The software required for development is installed on the local workstation.

---

## Files Modified

None.

---

## Required Software

| Software | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Git | Version control |
| GitHub Account | Source code hosting |
| Visual Studio Code | Source code editor |
| Node.js LTS | JavaScript runtime |
| npm | Package management |
| Docker | Containerization |
| Azure CLI | Azure resource management |
| kubectl | Kubernetes management |
| Kustomize | Kubernetes environment overlays |
| Google Chrome | Application testing |

---

- Which tools are required throughout the project lifecycle.
- Why development environment consistency is important.

---

## Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 20–30 minutes.

---

## Evidence

Use the following screenshot.

![Node.js Installation](/screenshots/Backend/07-Node24-Installation.png)

*Figure 2.1 – Development environment with Node.js installed.*

---

## Common Mistakes

- Installing an unsupported Node.js version.
- Forgetting to start the Docker daemon.

# Phase 3 — Repository Setup

## Goal

Create the FlavorForge source code repository structure, initialize version control, define project organization, and prepare the repository for application development and DevSecOps implementation.

The repository acts as the single source of truth for application code, infrastructure definitions, automation pipelines, documentation, and deployment configuration.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

After preparing the development environment, the next step is creating a controlled location where all project assets will be maintained.

Application development, Docker configuration, Kubernetes manifests, Azure DevOps pipelines, GitOps configuration, and documentation all depend on a properly structured repository.

Creating the repository before development ensures:

- Version history is maintained from the beginning.
- Team collaboration is possible.
- CI/CD automation can be connected later.
- Infrastructure and application code remain organized.

---

## Concept

A repository can be considered the central workspace for the entire project.

Instead of keeping frontend code, backend code, deployment files, and documentation in different locations, everything is maintained together with version control.

This allows developers and automation tools to always work with the same approved version of the project.

---

## Technical Explanation

FlavorForge uses Git as the version control system and GitHub as the remote repository platform.

The repository follows a monorepo approach where frontend, backend, infrastructure, automation, and documentation are stored within a single repository.

The monorepo structure provides:

- Centralized project management.
- Easier CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- Consistent version tracking.
- Simplified deployment automation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Git must be installed.
- GitHub account must be available.
- Development environment setup must be completed.
- Project architecture must be finalized.

---

# Repository Creation

## Step 1 — Create Project Directory

Create the local project directory.

```bash
mkdir flavorforge-azure-devsecops-capstone

cd flavorforge-azure-devsecops-capstone
```

---

## Step 2 — Initialize Git Repository

Initialize Git version control.

```bash
git init
```

Expected output:

```text
Initialized empty Git repository
```

---

## Step 3 — Configure Git Identity

Configure the developer identity used for commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

Verify:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

# Initial Repository Structure

## Step 4 — Create Main Project Directories

Create the initial project structure.

```bash
mkdir frontend
mkdir backend
mkdir docker
mkdir kubernetes

# Phase 4 — Frontend Development

## Goal

Develop the FlavorForge frontend application using React and Vite.

The objective of this phase is to create a production-ready user interface that can display recipe information, communicate with backend APIs, handle user navigation, and provide a foundation for containerization and deployment.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The repository structure has been created, but the application does not yet contain any functionality.

The frontend is developed before the backend integration phase because the user interface defines the requirements for backend communication.

Building the frontend first establishes:

- Application screens.
- User interactions.
- Required API endpoints.
- Component structure.
- Frontend build requirements.

---

## Concept

A frontend application is the part of the system that users interact with directly.

For FlavorForge:

- React creates the user interface.
- Components represent reusable UI elements.
- Services communicate with backend APIs.
- Pages represent complete application views.

The frontend acts as the presentation layer of the application.

---

## Technical Explanation

FlavorForge frontend is implemented using React with Vite as the build tool.

React provides a component-based architecture where the application is divided into reusable pieces.

Vite provides:

- Fast development server.
- Modern JavaScript bundling.
- Production optimization.
- Efficient build process.

The frontend follows a structured architecture separating:

- Components.
- Pages.
- API clients.
- Services.
- Styling.
- Testing utilities.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Phase 3 repository setup must be completed.
- Node.js must be installed.
- npm must be available.
- Git repository must exist.

Verification:

```bash
node --version

npm --version
```

---

# Frontend Creation

## Step 1 — Navigate to Frontend Directory

Move into the frontend folder.

```bash
cd frontend
```

---

## Step 2 — Create React Application

Create a Vite React application.

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```

Select:

```text
Framework:
React

Variant:
JavaScript
```

---

## Step 3 — Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 4 — Install Application Libraries

Install required frontend packages.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

Purpose:

`react-router-dom` provides client-side routing between application pages.

---

# Frontend Application Structure

The completed frontend follows this structure:

```text
frontend/

├── src/

│   ├── api
│   │   └── apiClient.js
│
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── Header

└── vite.config.js
```

---

# Step-by-Step Implementation

## Step 1 — Create Application Entry Point

The main application entry point is:

```text
src/main.jsx
```

Responsibilities:

- Mount React application.
- Configure routing.
- Load global styles.

---

## Step 2 — Create Application Routing

Routing allows users to navigate between pages.

Implemented pages:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home page |
| `/recipes` | Recipe listing |
| `/about` | About page |
| `/contact` | Contact page |

---

## Step 3 — Create Reusable Components

Reusable components were created to avoid duplicate UI logic.

Examples:

```text
Header

Footer

RecipeCard

SearchBar

CategoryFilter

Loading

ErrorBoundary
```

Benefits:

- Easier maintenance.
- Consistent design.
- Improved code reuse.

---

## Step 4 — Create Service Layer

Frontend communication with backend APIs is separated into service files.

Created:

```text
src/services/

healthService.js

recipeService.js
```

Purpose:

- Keep API logic separate from UI components.
- Simplify future backend changes.

---

## Step 5 — Configure API Client

Created:

```text
src/api/apiClient.js
```

Purpose:

- Centralize backend communication.
- Manage API base URL.
- Provide reusable HTTP configuration.

---

## Step 6 — Implement Styling

Created:

```text
src/styles/

global.css

variables.css
```

Purpose:

- Maintain consistent design.
- Avoid duplicated styling.
- Support reusable UI patterns.

---

---

# Common Mistakes

## Running npm commands from the wrong directory

Incorrect:

```bash
npm install
```

from repository root.

Correct:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## Hardcoding backend URLs

Avoid:

```javascript
http://localhost:3000
```

Use environment-based configuration.

---

## Creating large components

Avoid putting the entire application inside:

```text
App.jsx
```

Use reusable components.

---

## Forgetting production build testing

Development mode may work while production build fails.

Always verify:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- React application structure.
- Component-based frontend development.
- Client-side routing.
- API service separation.
- Production frontend builds.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2–3 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 5

Confirm:

- React application runs locally.
- All pages load successfully.
- Components are reusable.
- API service layer exists.
- Production build succeeds.

The frontend is now ready for backend integration.

# Phase 5 — Backend Development

## Goal

Develop the FlavorForge backend API using Node.js and Express.

The objective of this phase is to create a reliable backend service that provides application data, exposes REST APIs, supports frontend communication, and provides health monitoring endpoints required for containerized and Kubernetes deployments.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The frontend application requires backend services to retrieve and process application data.

After creating the frontend structure, the backend is developed to provide:

- REST API endpoints.
- Business logic.
- Application services.
- Health monitoring.
- Backend testing.

The backend is implemented before Dockerization because container images must be created from a working application.

---

## Concept

The backend is the application layer responsible for processing requests and returning responses.

For FlavorForge:

- The frontend sends requests.
- The backend receives requests.
- Controllers handle incoming requests.
- Services contain application logic.
- Routes define API endpoints.

The backend acts as the communication layer between the user interface and application data.

---

## Technical Explanation

FlavorForge backend is implemented using Node.js with the Express framework.

The backend follows a layered architecture:

```text
Client Request

       │

       ▼

Routes Layer

       │

       ▼

Controller Layer

       │

       ▼

Service Layer

       │

       ▼

Response
```

This separation improves:

- Maintainability.
- Testing.
- Scalability.

# Common Mistakes

## Mixing business logic with routes

Avoid putting application logic directly inside route files.

Use:

```text
Route
 ↓
Controller
 ↓
Service
```

---

## Missing health endpoint

Kubernetes requires health checks.

Always provide:

```text
/api/health
```

---

## Incorrect CORS configuration

Symptoms:

- Frontend cannot communicate with backend.
- Browser shows CORS errors.

Solution:

Configure allowed frontend origins.

---

## Not testing before Dockerization

Always verify:

```bash
npm test

npm start
```

before creating Docker images.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Node.js backend development.
- Express REST API design.
- Layered backend architecture.
- API testing.
- Health endpoint design for cloud deployments.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2–4 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 6

Confirm:

- Backend server runs successfully.
- Health API works.
- Recipe API works.
- Tests pass.
- Frontend and backend requirements are understood.

The application is now ready for local integration.

# Phase 6 — Local Frontend and Backend Integration

## Goal

Connect the FlavorForge React frontend application with the Node.js backend API and verify complete application functionality in a local development environment.

The objective of this phase is to ensure that:

- Frontend requests reach the backend.
- Backend APIs return expected responses.
- CORS configuration works correctly.
- Application functionality works before containerization.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The frontend and backend were developed independently in previous phases.

Before creating Docker images, the complete application flow must be verified locally.

Containerizing an application that has not been tested end-to-end can make troubleshooting more difficult because failures may come from:

- Application code.
- Network configuration.
- Docker configuration.
- Container communication.

Therefore, local integration is completed before Dockerization.

---

## Concept

The frontend and backend are two separate applications.

The frontend is responsible for displaying information to users.

The backend is responsible for processing requests and returning data.

Integration connects both layers:

```text
User Browser

      │

      ▼

React Frontend

      │

      ▼

Node.js Backend API

      │

      ▼

Response Data
```

---

## Technical Explanation

The React application communicates with the Express backend through HTTP API requests.

The frontend uses an API service layer to send requests.

The backend exposes REST endpoints.

CORS is configured to allow communication between different local development servers.

Typical local setup:

```text
Frontend

http://localhost:5173


        ↓


Backend API

http://localhost:3000
```

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Frontend development must be completed.
- Backend development must be completed.
- Both applications must run independently.

Verification:

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend

npm run dev
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend

npm run dev
```

---

# Step-by-Step Tasks

## Step 1 — Start Backend Server

Navigate to backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

Start application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected:

```text
Server running on port 3000
```

---

## Step 2 — Verify Backend API

Test health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Expected:

```json
{
 "status":"healthy"
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Configure Frontend API URL

The frontend must know where the backend API is running.

Development API URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The API URL is managed through frontend configuration rather than hardcoded values.

---

## Step 4 — Configure Backend CORS

The backend must allow requests from the frontend application.

Frontend origin:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Backend configuration:

```text
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Step 5 — Start Frontend Application

Navigate to frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected:

```text
Local:
http://localhost:5173/
```

---

## Step 6 — Verify Application Communication

Open browser:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Verify:

- Frontend loads successfully.
- Backend data is displayed.
- API calls complete successfully.
- No browser CORS errors appear.

---

![Category Filtering Working](/screenshots/Frontend/25-Category-Filtering-Working.png)

*Figure 6.4 – Category filtering functionality verified.*

---

# Common Mistakes

## Incorrect backend URL

Problem:

Frontend sends requests to the wrong address.

Example:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

when backend runs on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Solution:

Verify environment configuration.

---

## CORS errors

Browser message:

```text
Blocked by CORS policy
```

Cause:

Backend does not allow frontend origin.

Solution:

Update backend CORS configuration.

---

## Testing only frontend

A frontend page loading does not mean integration is working.

Always verify:

- API calls.
- Backend responses.
- Browser network requests.

---

## Moving to Docker too early

Docker should package a working application.

First verify:

```text
Frontend works

+

Backend works

+

Integration works
```

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Frontend and backend communication.
- REST API integration.
- CORS configuration.
- Local application testing.
- Importance of validating applications before containerization.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 1–2 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 7

Confirm:

- Frontend runs locally.
- Backend runs locally.
- Frontend communicates with backend.
- APIs return expected responses.
- Application works without errors.

The application is now ready for Docker containerization.

# Phase 7 — Dockerization

## Goal

Containerize the FlavorForge frontend and backend applications using Docker.

The objective of this phase is to package the application and its dependencies into portable Docker images that can run consistently across development, testing, and cloud environments.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The application has been verified locally in the previous phase.

Before deploying to Azure, the application must be converted into containers.

Kubernetes does not run raw source code. It runs container images.

Therefore, Dockerization must be completed before:

- Azure Container Registry configuration.
- Azure Kubernetes Service deployment.
- Kubernetes workload creation.

---

## Concept

A Docker container is a packaged environment containing:

- Application code.
- Runtime dependencies.
- Configuration.
- Required libraries.

Instead of installing Node.js, npm packages, and application dependencies manually on every server, Docker creates a repeatable package that can run anywhere Docker is available.

A simple comparison:

Without Docker:

```text
Developer Machine

Install Node.js

Install Packages

Configure Environment

Run Application
```

With Docker:

```text
Docker Image

      |

      ▼

Same Application Environment Everywhere
```

---

## Technical Explanation

FlavorForge uses Docker to create separate images for:

1. Frontend application.
2. Backend API application.

The frontend uses a multi-stage Docker build:

```text
Stage 1

Node.js image

      |

      ▼

Build React application


Stage 2

NGINX image

      |

      ▼

Serve production static files
```

The backend uses a Node.js container:

```text
Node.js Runtime

      |

      ▼

Express API Application
```

Docker Compose is used locally to verify that both containers communicate correctly.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Frontend application must work locally.
- Backend application must work locally.
- Docker must be installed.
- Docker daemon must be running.

Verification:

```bash
docker --version

docker compose version
```

---

# Docker Architecture

The container flow:

```text

```text
backend/Dockerfile
```

Purpose:

Define how the backend application image is created.

The backend container includes:

- Node.js runtime.
- Application dependencies.
- Express application.
- Required configuration.

---

# Step 2 — Build Backend Docker Image

Navigate:

```bash
cd backend
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Expected:

```json
{
 "status":"healthy"
}
```

---

# Step 5 — Create Frontend Dockerfile

Location:

```text
frontend/Dockerfile
```

The frontend uses a multi-stage build.

Purpose:

- Build React production files.
- Serve optimized files using NGINX.

---

# Step 6 — Build Frontend Docker Image

Navigate:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Build:

```bash
docker build -t flavorforge-frontend .
```

Verify:

```bash
docker images
```

Expected:

```text
flavorforge-frontend
```

---

# Step 7 — Create Docker Network

Create a network for container communication.

```bash
docker network create flavorforge-network
```

Verify:

```bash
docker network ls
```

---

# Step 8 — Connect Backend Container

Remove previous container if required:

```bash
docker rm -f flavorforge-backend
```

Run backend with network:

```bash
docker run -d \
--network flavorforge-network \
-p 3000:3000 \
--name flavorforge-backend \
flavorforge-backend
```

---

# Step 9 — Run Frontend Container

Start frontend:

```bash
docker run -d \
--network flavorforge-network \
-p 5173:80 \
--name flavorforge-frontend \
flavorforge-frontend
```

---

# Step 10 — Verify Running Containers

---

# Common Mistakes

## Docker daemon not running

Error:

```text
Cannot connect to Docker daemon
```

Solution:

Start Docker service.

---

## Wrong build directory

Incorrect:

```bash
docker build .
```

from repository root.

Correct:

```bash
cd frontend

docker build .
```

or:

```bash
cd backend

docker build .
```

---

## Port conflicts

Example:

```text
Port 3000 already in use
```

Check:

```bash
docker ps
```

Stop old containers:

```bash
docker stop <container-name>
```

---

## Frontend cannot reach backend

Possible causes:

- Incorrect API URL.
- Missing Docker network.
- Wrong container name.

Verify:

```bash
docker network inspect flavorforge-network
```

---

## Building images without testing locally

Always verify containers before pushing images to Azure.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Docker image creation.
- Multi-stage frontend builds.
- Container networking.
- Docker Compose.
- Running applications in isolated environments.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2–3 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 8

Confirm:

- Frontend Docker image exists.
- Backend Docker image exists.
- Containers start successfully.
- Docker Compose works.
- Application runs using containers.

The application is now ready for Azure cloud deployment.

# Phase 8 — Azure Cloud Infrastructure Setup

## Goal

Prepare the Microsoft Azure environment required for hosting the FlavorForge DevSecOps platform.

The objective of this phase is to create the Azure foundation where:

- Container images will be stored.
- Kubernetes workloads will run.
- Cloud resources will be managed securely.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The application has been developed and containerized locally.

The next step is moving from local infrastructure to cloud infrastructure.

Azure resources must exist before:

- Docker images can be pushed to Azure Container Registry.
- Kubernetes clusters can be created.
- Application containers can be deployed.

The Azure foundation is created before ACR and AKS because these services depend on the resource group and cloud configuration.

---

# Concept

Imagine Azure as a large cloud data center where different services are available.

A resource group is like a project folder inside Azure.

For FlavorForge:

```text
Azure Subscription

        |

        ▼

Resource Group

        |

        ├── Azure Container Registry (ACR)

        |

        ├── Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

        |

        ├── Load Balancer

        |

        └── Networking Resources
```

All project resources are organized inside one resource group.

---

# Technical Explanation

Azure Resource Groups provide lifecycle management for related resources.

The FlavorForge project uses Azure CLI to automate infrastructure preparation.

Azure CLI allows developers to:

- Authenticate with Azure.
- Create resources.
- Configure services.
- Automate cloud operations.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Azure account must exist.
- Azure subscription must be active.
- Azure CLI must be installed.
- Docker images must already exist locally.

Verify Azure CLI:

```bash
az --version
```

Verify Docker:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

# Step-by-Step Tasks

# Step 1 — Login to Azure

Authenticate Azure CLI.

Command:

```bash
az login
```

A browser window opens for authentication.

Expected result:

```text
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "isDefault": true
  }
]
```

---

# Step 2 — Verify Azure Account

Check active subscription.

```bash
az account show
```

Example output:

```json
{
 "name": "Azure Subscription",
 "state": "Enabled"
}
```

---

# Step 3 — List Available Subscriptions

If multiple subscriptions exist:

```bash
az account list
```

---

# Step 4 — Select Subscription

Set the required subscription:

```bash
az account set \
--subscription "<subscription-id>"
```

Verify:

```bash
az account show
```

---

# Step 5 — Create Resource Group

Create the main FlavorForge resource container.

Command:

```bash
az group create \
--name flavorforge-rg \
--location eastus
```

Explanation:

```text
flavorforge-rg

= Azure resource group name


eastus

= Azure deployment region
```

Expected response:

```json
{
 "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
}
```

---

# Step 6 — Verify Resource Group

List resource groups:

```bash
az group list -o table
```

Expected:

```text
flavorforge-rg
eastus
Succeeded
```

---

# Step 7 — Register Required Azure Providers

Azure services require registered providers before resource creation.

Register Container Registry provider:

```bash
az provider register \
--namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```

Register Container Service provider:

```bash
az provider register \
--namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

Verify:

```bash
az provider list \
--query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.ContainerRegistry']" \
-o table
```

---

# Azure Infrastructure Structure

After this phase:

```text
Azure Subscription

        |

        ▼

# Common Mistakes

## Using the wrong subscription

Problem:

Resources are created in an unexpected Azure subscription.

Solution:

Check:

```bash
az account show
```

---

## Incorrect Azure region

Problem:

Some services may not be available or may have different pricing.

Solution:

Choose a supported region.

Example:

```text
eastus
```

---

## Creating resources without a resource group

Problem:

Resources become difficult to manage.

Solution:

Always organize project resources inside a dedicated resource group.

---

## Forgetting provider registration

Error:

```text
Resource provider not registered
```

Solution:

Register required providers:

```bash
az provider register
```

# Phase 9 — Azure Container Registry (ACR) Setup

## Goal

Create and configure Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store FlavorForge Docker images securely in Azure.

The objective of this phase is to make application container images available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployments.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The application has been successfully containerized locally.

However, Kubernetes clusters cannot use images that exist only on a developer laptop.

The images must be stored in a cloud container registry that AKS can access.

Therefore, ACR is created before AKS deployment.

The deployment flow becomes:

```text
Developer Machine

        |

        ▼

Docker Build

        |

        ▼

Azure Container Registry

        |

        ▼

Azure Kubernetes Service

        |

        ▼

Running Application
```

---

# Concept

Imagine ACR is an online cupboard where Docker images are stored.

Instead of keeping application images only on your laptop, ACR stores them securely in Azure.

AKS opens this cupboard and downloads the required images when creating application containers.

Example:

```text
Local Computer

flavorforge-frontend:v1

flavorforge-backend:v1


          |

          ▼


Azure Container Registry

flavorforge.azurecr.io

          |

          ▼


AKS Cluster

Pulls images during deployment
```

---

# Technical Explanation

Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry service provided by Azure.

It stores:

- Container images.
- Image versions.
- Image metadata.
- Repository information.

FlavorForge uses ACR as the private image repository for:

```text
Frontend Application

Backend API
```

AKS later authenticates with ACR to pull these images.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Azure resource group must exist.
- Docker images must be built locally.
- Azure CLI must be authenticated.

Verify:

```bash
az account show
```

# Common Mistakes

## Incorrect ACR naming

Azure Container Registry names must be globally unique.

Example:

Incorrect:

```text
flavorforge
```

if already used.

Solution:

Choose another unique name.

---

## Forgetting ACR login

Error:

```text
unauthorized
```

Solution:

Run:

```bash
az acr login --name <acr-name>
```

---

## Incorrect image tagging

Wrong:

```text
flavorforge-backend:v1
```

Correct:

```text
registry.azurecr.io/flavorforge-backend:v1
```

The registry address is required.

---

## Pushing before tagging

Docker push requires a registry-qualified image name.

Correct flow:

```text
Build

↓

Tag

↓

Push
```

---

## Using latest tags only

Using only:

```text
latest
```

makes deployments difficult to track.

Recommended:

```text
v1

v1.1

Build ID
```

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Private container registries.
- Docker image tagging.
- Image publishing workflow.
- Cloud image management.
- How Kubernetes obtains application images.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 1 hour.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 10

Confirm:

- ACR exists.
- Docker login succeeds.
- Frontend image is pushed.
- Backend image is pushed.
- Images are visible in ACR.

The container images are now ready for Kubernetes deployment.

# Phase 10 — Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Creation and Configuration

## Goal

Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that will host the FlavorForge application containers.

The objective of this phase is to prepare a managed Kubernetes environment capable of:

- Running frontend and backend containers.
- Managing application replicas.
- Performing rolling deployments.
- Integrating with Azure Container Registry.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The Docker images have been created and stored in Azure Container Registry.

However, images alone cannot run the application.

A Kubernetes cluster is required to:

- Pull images from ACR.
- Create containers.
- Maintain application availability.
- Manage scaling and networking.

The deployment flow is:

```text

```

---

# Concept

Imagine AKS as a managed computer system that runs containers.

Instead of manually starting containers:

```text
docker run frontend

docker run backend
```

Kubernetes automatically manages them:

```text
AKS Cluster

    |

    ├── Frontend Pods

    |

    ├── Backend Pods

    |

    ├── Services

    |

    └── Networking
```

---

# Technical Explanation

Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes platform.

Microsoft manages the Kubernetes control plane while developers manage workloads.

FlavorForge uses AKS for:

- Container orchestration.
- Application deployment.
- Replica management.
- Service discovery.
- Cloud scaling.

The AKS cluster is connected to ACR so Kubernetes can securely pull private images.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- Azure resource group exists.
- ACR exists.
- Docker images are pushed to ACR.
- Azure CLI is authenticated.

Verify:

```bash
az account show
```

# Common Mistakes

## Creating AKS before ACR

Problem:

Kubernetes cannot pull application images.

Correct order:

```text
ACR

↓

AKS

↓

Deployment
```

---

## Forgetting to attach ACR

Error:

```text
ImagePullBackOff
```

Cause:

AKS cannot authenticate with private registry.

Solution:

Run:

```bash
az aks update \
--attach-acr
```

---

## Wrong Kubernetes context

Problem:

kubectl commands target the wrong cluster.

Check:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

Switch:

```bash
kubectl config use-context flavorforge-aks
```

---

## Insufficient node resources

Symptoms:

- Pods remain Pending.
- Deployments fail.

Solution:

Check:

```bash
kubectl describe nodes
```

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Managed Kubernetes on Azure.
- AKS cluster creation.
- Kubernetes CLI connectivity.
- Azure identity integration.
- Container registry integration.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 1–2 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 11

Confirm:

- AKS cluster exists.
- kubectl connects successfully.
- Nodes are Ready.
- AKS can access ACR.

The Kubernetes platform is now ready for application deployment.

# Phase 11 — Kubernetes Manifests and Application Deployment

## Goal

Deploy the FlavorForge frontend and backend applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kubernetes manifests and Kustomize.

The objective of this phase is to create a Kubernetes-managed application environment containing:

- Namespace isolation.
- Application deployments.
- Internal services.
- Configuration management.
- Environment-specific deployment overlays.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The AKS cluster is now running and connected to Azure Container Registry.

However, AKS only provides the Kubernetes platform.

The application workloads still need to be defined.

Kubernetes requires configuration files describing:

- Which containers to run.
- Which images to use.
- How many replicas are required.
- How applications communicate.

Therefore, Kubernetes manifests are created after AKS setup.

---

# Concept

Kubernetes does not directly understand application source code.

It uses declarative YAML files that describe the desired state.

Example:

Instead of manually running:

```bash
docker run backend
```

Kubernetes receives:

```yaml
Run backend container

Create 2 replicas

Expose service

Restart if failure occurs
```

Kubernetes continuously works to maintain this desired state.

---

# Technical Explanation

FlavorForge uses Kubernetes manifests with Kustomize.

Kustomize allows maintaining common Kubernetes configuration while applying environment-specific changes.

Structure:

```text
Base Configuration

        |

        ▼

Environment Overlay

```

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- AKS cluster must be running.
- kubectl must connect successfully.
- ACR images must exist.

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected:

```

Cause:

Kubernetes cannot find image in ACR.

Solution:

Check deployment image:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

## Wrong namespace

Problem:

Resources appear missing.

Check:

```bash
kubectl get all -n flavorforge
```

---

## Applying files in wrong order

Recommended order:

```text
Namespace

↓

ConfigMap

↓

Secret

↓

Backend

↓

Frontend

↓

Services
```

---

## Forgetting Kustomize path

Wrong:

```bash
kubectl apply -f overlays/dev
```

Correct:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
```

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Kubernetes declarative deployment.
- Pods and deployments.
- Services.
- ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- Kustomize environment management.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 3–4 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 12

# Phase 12 — Kubernetes Ingress and External Application Access

## Goal

Expose the FlavorForge application outside the AKS cluster using Kubernetes Ingress and an external Azure Load Balancer.

The objective of this phase is to provide external access to:

- Frontend web application.
- Backend API endpoints.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

At the end of the previous phase, the application was successfully running inside AKS.

However, Kubernetes Services were only accessible internally.

Users on the internet cannot directly access:

```text
Frontend Pod

Backend Pod
```

A routing layer is required.

Ingress provides:

- External access.
- URL routing.
- Traffic management.

Therefore, Ingress is configured after application deployments.

---

# Concept

Imagine Ingress as a receptionist at the entrance of a building.

Without Ingress:

```text
Visitor

    |

    ?

Which application?
```

With Ingress:

```text
Visitor

    |

Reception Desk

    |

    ├── Frontend Request

    |

    └── Backend API Request
```

---

# Technical Explanation

Kubernetes Ingress manages external HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

FlavorForge uses:

```text
NGINX Ingress Controller
```

The traffic flow:

```text

ingress-nginx-controller

Running
```

---

# Step 3 — Verify Azure Load Balancer

The ingress controller creates an Azure Load Balancer.

Run:

```bash
kubectl get services \
-n ingress-nginx
```

Expected:

```text
EXTERNAL-IP
```

Example:

```text
104.xx.xx.xx
```

---

# Step 4 — Change Application Services

The application services should become internal services.

Ingress handles external traffic.

Frontend:

```text
LoadBalancer

        ↓

ClusterIP
```

Backend:

```text
LoadBalancer

        ↓

ClusterIP
```

Update:

```text
kubernetes/base/frontend/service.yaml

kubernetes/base/backend/service.yaml
```

Service type:

```yaml
type: ClusterIP
```

Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply \
-k kubernetes/base
```

---

# Step 5 — Create Ingress Resource

File:

```text
kubernetes/base/ingress/ingress.yaml
```

Purpose:

Define routing rules.

Example:

```text
/

        →

frontend-service


/api

        →

backend-service
```

Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply \
-f kubernetes/base/ingress/
```

---

# Step 6 — Verify Ingress Resource

Run:

```bash
kubectl get ingress \
-n flavorforge
```

Expected:

```text
ADDRESS

External IP
```

---

# Step 7 — Get External Address

Command:

```bash
kubectl get service \
-n ingress-nginx
```

Copy:

```text
EXTERNAL-IP
```

Example:

```text
http://104.xx.xx.xx
```

---

# Step 8 — Test Frontend

Open:

```text
http://<external-ip>
```

Expected:

FlavorForge website loads.

---

# Step 9 — Test Backend API

Open:

```text
http://<external-ip>/api/health

# Common Mistakes

## Exposing every service as LoadBalancer

Incorrect:

```text
Frontend Service → LoadBalancer

Backend Service → LoadBalancer
```

Problems:

- More public IPs.
- Higher cost.
- Poor architecture.

Correct:

```text
One LoadBalancer

↓

Ingress

↓

Internal Services
```

---

## Ingress controller not running

Check:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

---

## No external IP assigned

Check:

```bash
kubectl describe service \
ingress-nginx-controller \
-n ingress-nginx
```

---

## Wrong routing path

Verify:

```text
/api

/

```

match ingress rules.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Kubernetes Ingress.
- NGINX routing.
- Azure Load Balancer integration.
- External application exposure.
- Production-style Kubernetes networking.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 13

Confirm:

- NGINX Ingress controller is running.
- Azure Load Balancer has public IP.
- Frontend is accessible.
- Backend API is accessible.

FlavorForge is now publicly reachable from Azure.

# Phase 13 — Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

## Goal

Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale FlavorForge application pods based on resource utilization.

The objective of this phase is to improve application availability and handle increased traffic automatically.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The FlavorForge application is now:

- Running inside AKS.
- Accessible through Ingress.
- Managed by Kubernetes.

However, the application currently runs with a fixed number of replicas.

Example:

```text
Backend Deployment

Replica Count = 2
```

If traffic increases:

```text
More Users

     |

     ▼

Higher CPU Usage

     |

     ▼

Application Load Increases
```

Kubernetes needs a mechanism to automatically add more pods.

That mechanism is HPA.

---

# Concept

Imagine a restaurant kitchen.

Without autoscaling:

```text
10 customers

1 chef
```

The chef becomes overloaded.

With autoscaling:

```text
10 customers

1 chef


100 customers

5 chefs
```

HPA works similarly by increasing application pods when demand increases.

---

# Technical Explanation

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas.

HPA monitors:

- CPU utilization.
- Memory utilization.
- Resource metrics.

FlavorForge uses HPA to scale backend workloads.

Example:

```text
Minimum replicas:

2


Maximum replicas:

5


Target CPU:

70%
```

Meaning:

```text
CPU < 70%

Keep replicas


CPU > 70%

Create more replicas
```

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this phase:

- AKS cluster must be running.
- Metrics Server must be available.
- Backend deployment must exist.

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get deployments \
-n flavorforge
```

---

# Step-by-Step Tasks

# Step 1 — Verify Metrics Server

Kubernetes requires metrics collection before HPA can work.

Check:

```bash
kubectl top nodes
```

Expected:

```text
CPU

Memory
```

If metrics are available, the Metrics Server is working.

---

# Step 2 — Verify Pod Metrics

Run:

```bash
kubectl top pods \
-n flavorforge
```

Example:

```text
backend pod

CPU usage

Memory usage
```

---

# Step 3 — Create HPA Manifest

File:

```text
kubernetes/base/autoscaling/hpa.yaml
```

Purpose:

Define automatic scaling rules.

Example:

```yaml
minReplicas: 2

maxReplicas: 5

targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
```

---

# Step 4 — Apply HPA Configuration

Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply \
-f kubernetes/base/autoscaling/hpa.yaml
```

---

# Step 5 — Verify HPA

Run:

```bash
kubectl get hpa \
-n flavorforge
```

Expected:

```text
NAME

REFERENCE

TARGETS

MINPODS

MAXPODS
```

Example:

```text
backend-hpa

70%

2

5
```

---

# Step 6 — Describe HPA

Detailed information:

```bash
kubectl describe hpa \
backend-hpa \
-n flavorforge
```

Verify:

- Target CPU.
- Current replicas.
- Scaling events.

---

# Step 7 — Verify Deployment Integration

Run:

```bash
kubectl get deployment \
-n flavorforge
```

Confirm backend deployment is controlled by HPA.

---

# Common Mistakes

## HPA shows unknown metrics

Example:

```text
TARGETS unknown
```

Cause:

Metrics Server is unavailable.

Check:

```bash
kubectl top pods
```

---

## Missing resource requests

HPA requires CPU requests.

Example:

```yaml
resources:
 requests:
   cpu: 100m
```

Without requests, Kubernetes cannot calculate utilization.

---

## Scaling wrong deployment

Check:

```bash
kubectl get hpa -n flavorforge
```

Confirm:

```text
REFERENCE

backend deployment
```

---

## Setting unrealistic limits

Example:

```text
minimum replicas: 1

maximum replicas: 100
```

can create unexpected costs.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Kubernetes autoscaling.
- Metrics Server.
- Resource monitoring.
- Dynamic replica management.
- Production availability patterns.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 1–2 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 14

Confirm:

- Metrics Server works.
- HPA resource exists.
- Backend pods are monitored.
- Scaling rules are configured.

FlavorForge now has automatic workload scaling capability.

# Phase 14 — Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Goal

Create an automated Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, secures, packages, and deploys the FlavorForge application.

The objective of this phase is to implement a complete DevSecOps lifecycle.

---

## Why This Phase Comes Now

The application is already:

- Developed.
- Containerized.
- Stored in ACR.
- Running on AKS.

However, deployments are still manual.

A production DevOps workflow requires automation.

The pipeline connects:

```text

# Phase 15 — Multi-Environment Azure DevOps Release Simulation

## Goal

Implement an enterprise-style release workflow using Azure DevOps environments, approvals, variable groups, and deployment stages.

The objective of this phase is to simulate a real production delivery process:

```text
Developer Commit

        |

        ▼

Build & Validation

        |

        ▼

Development Environment

        |

        ▼

QA Environment

        |

        ▼

Production Environment
```

---

# Why This Phase Comes Now

The previous phase created a working CI/CD pipeline.

However, enterprise applications are not deployed directly from development into production.

A controlled release process is required.

Organizations normally use multiple environments:

```text
Development

    ↓

Quality Assurance

    ↓

Production
```

Each environment provides:

- Validation.
- Testing.
- Approval control.
- Deployment safety.

---

# Concept

Imagine releasing a new version of a mobile application.

You do not immediately publish it to millions of users.

The process is:

```text
Developer Testing

        ↓

Internal Testing

        ↓

User Testing

        ↓

Public Release
```

Azure DevOps environments provide the same controlled approach.

---

# Technical Explanation

FlavorForge uses Azure DevOps multi-stage YAML deployment.

The release flow contains:

```text
Build Stage

        |

        ▼

Deploy Dev

        |

        ▼

Deploy QA

        |

        ▼

Deploy Production
```

Each environment has:

- Deployment job.
- Kubernetes target.
- Approval checks.
- Environment variables.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting:

- Azure DevOps pipeline works.
- AKS cluster exists.
- Kubernetes manifests exist.
- Azure service connection exists.

# Common Mistakes

## Deploying directly to production

Incorrect:

```text
Build

↓

Production
```

Correct:

```text
Build

↓

Dev

↓

QA

↓

Production
```

---

## Missing approvals

Problem:

Production can deploy automatically.

Solution:

Configure:

```text
Approvals and Checks
```

---

## Incorrect Kubernetes namespace

Problem:

Deployment goes to wrong environment.

Check:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

---

## Variable mismatch

Example:

Pipeline variable:

```text
AKS_CLUSTER
```

YAML expects:

```text
aksClusterName
```

Ensure names match.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Enterprise release management.
- Azure DevOps environments.
- Manual approvals.
- Deployment jobs.
- Environment separation.
- Production release practices.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 3–4 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 16

Confirm:

- Dev deployment works.
- QA deployment works.
- Production deployment works.
- Approvals are configured.
- Pipeline tracks deployments.

FlavorForge now follows an enterprise release workflow.

# Phase 16 — Argo CD GitOps Continuous Deployment

## Goal

Implement GitOps-based deployment using Argo CD to continuously synchronize Kubernetes workloads from the Git repository to the AKS cluster.

The objective of this phase is to make Git the single source of truth for Kubernetes deployments.

---

# Why This Phase Comes Now

The previous phase implemented Azure DevOps release pipelines.

However, traditional deployment works like this:

```text
Pipeline

    |

    ▼

kubectl apply

    |

    ▼

Kubernetes Cluster
```

The pipeline directly changes the cluster.

GitOps changes this approach.

The desired state is stored in Git:

```text
Git Repository

        |

        ▼

Argo CD

        |

        ▼

AKS Cluster
```

Argo CD continuously compares:

```text
Git Desired State

        VS

AKS Current State
```

and automatically corrects differences.

---

# Concept

Imagine a security guard checking a building blueprint.

Blueprint:

```text
Git Repository
```

Actual building:

```text
AKS Cluster
```

The guard:

```text
Argo CD
```

checks:

```text
Does the building match the blueprint?
```

If something changes:

```text
Restore the correct design
```

This is GitOps self-healing.

---

# Technical Explanation

Argo CD is a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool.

FlavorForge uses:

```text
Git Repository

        |

        ▼

Argo CD Application

        |

        ▼

Kubernetes Resources
```

Argo CD manages:

- Deployments.
- Services.
- ConfigMaps.
- Ingress.
- Replica configuration.

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting:

- AKS cluster must be running.
- Kubernetes manifests must exist.
- Git repository must contain Kubernetes configuration.

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected:

```text
STATUS

Ready
```

Verify Kubernetes files:

```bash
ls kubernetes
```

Expected:

```text
base

overlays
```

---

# GitOps Architecture

Final architecture:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

---

# Step 2 — Install Argo CD Components

Apply official installation manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply \
-n argocd \
-f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

---

# Step 3 — Verify Argo CD Pods

# Step 5 — Create Argo CD Application

File:

```text
argocd/flavorforge-app.yaml
```

Purpose:

Defines:

- Repository location.
- Kubernetes namespace.
- Deployment source.
- Synchronization policy.

Example structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1

kind: Application
```

---

# Step 6 — Apply Argo CD Application

```bash
kubectl apply \
-f argocd/flavorforge-app.yaml
```

---

# Step 7 — Verify Application

Check:

```bash
kubectl get applications \
-n argocd
```

Expected:

```text
flavorforge-app

Healthy
```

---

# Step 8 — Verify Argo CD Tree

Argo CD displays:

```text
Application

 |

 ├── Namespace

 ├── Deployment

 ├── Service

 ├── ConfigMap

 └── Pods
```

---

# GitOps Synchronization Flow

Example:

Developer changes:

```yaml

---

# Common Mistakes

## Argo CD application shows OutOfSync

Cause:

Git state differs from cluster state.

Solution:

Synchronize application:

```bash
argocd app sync flavorforge-app
```

---

## Argo CD cannot access repository

Check:

- Repository URL.
- Repository permissions.
- Branch name.

---

## Application namespace missing

Check:

```yaml
destination:
 namespace:
```

---

## Manual kubectl changes disappear

Expected behavior.

GitOps principle:

```text
Git is the source of truth
```

Argo CD restores the Git-defined state.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- GitOps principles.
- Argo CD deployment model.
- Continuous synchronization.
- Kubernetes self-healing.
- Declarative infrastructure management.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2–3 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 17

Confirm:

- Argo CD is installed.
- FlavorForge application exists.
- Application status is Healthy.
- Application status is Synced.
- Kubernetes workloads are managed through Git.

FlavorForge now follows a GitOps deployment model.

# Phase 17 — Monitoring and Observability

## Goal

Implement monitoring and observability practices for the FlavorForge application running on Azure Kubernetes Service.

The objective of this phase is to understand:

- Application health.
- Container status.
- Kubernetes workload state.
- Runtime logs.
- Deployment events.
- Operational troubleshooting.

---

# Why This Phase Comes Now

After implementing:

- AKS deployment.
- Kubernetes networking.
- Autoscaling.
- CI/CD.
- GitOps.

the application is production-ready.

However, production systems require visibility.

A running application is not enough.

Teams must answer:

```text
Is the application healthy?

Are users experiencing errors?

Are pods running correctly?

Why did a deployment fail?
```

Monitoring provides these answers.

---

# Concept

Imagine driving a car.

Without monitoring:

```text
Car is moving

but

No dashboard information
```

You cannot see:

- Fuel level.
- Engine temperature.
- Problems.

Observability provides the dashboard.

For FlavorForge:

```text
Application

=

Car


Monitoring

=

Dashboard
```

---

# Technical Explanation

FlavorForge uses multiple observability layers.

## Layer 1 — Application Monitoring

Backend exposes:

```text
/api/health
```

Purpose:

Verify application availability.

Example response:

```json
{
 "status":"healthy"
}
```

---

## Layer 2 — Container Monitoring

Docker and Kubernetes provide:

- Container status.
- Restart count.
- Runtime information.

Commands:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

---

## Layer 3 — Kubernetes Monitoring

Kubernetes provides:

- Pod status.
- Deployment status.
- Replica status.
- Events.

Commands:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

and:

```bash
kubectl describe pod
```

---

## Layer 4 — Azure Monitoring

Azure provides:

- AKS monitoring.
- Resource health.
- Cluster visibility.

---

# Observability Architecture

Use the following architecture diagram:

![Cloud Observability Architecture](/docs/diagrams/cloud-observability-architecture-diagram.png)

*Figure 17.1 – FlavorForge cloud observability architecture.*

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting:

- AKS cluster running.
- Application deployed.
- Kubernetes namespace created.
- Services available.

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n flavorforge
```

Expected:

```text
Running
```

---

# Step-by-Step Tasks

# Step 1 — Verify Application Health Endpoint

Backend health endpoint:

```text
/api/health
```

Test:

```bash
curl http://<external-ip>/api/health
```

Expected:

```json
{
 "status":"healthy"
}
```

---

# Step 2 — Monitor Pod Status

Command:

```bash
kubectl get pods \
-n flavorforge
```

Verify:

```text
STATUS

Running
```

---

# Step 3 — View Application Logs

Backend logs:

```bash
kubectl logs \
<backend-pod-name> \
-n flavorforge
```

Logs help identify:

- Application errors.
- API failures.
- Startup issues.

---

# Step 4 — View Kubernetes Events

Command:

```bash
kubectl get events \
-n flavorforge
```

Events show:

- Scheduling.
- Image pulls.
- Deployment changes.
- Failures.

---

# Step 5 — Check Deployment Status

Command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments \
-n flavorforge
```

Expected:

```text
READY

AVAILABLE
```

---

# Step 6 — Check Replica Sets

Command:

```bash
kubectl get replicasets \
-n flavorforge
```

Purpose:

Verify Kubernetes maintains desired replicas.

---

# Step 7 — Resource Monitoring

Check pod resource usage:

```bash
kubectl top pods \
-n flavorforge
```

Displays:

```text
CPU

Memory
```

This information is used by HPA.

---

# Operational Troubleshooting Flow

When users report an issue:

Follow:

```text
User Issue

      |

      ▼

Check Application Health

      |

      ▼

Check Pod Status

      |

      ▼

# Common Mistakes

## Application works but no monitoring exists

Problem:

No visibility into failures.

Solution:

Always verify:

```bash
kubectl logs

kubectl events

health endpoint
```

---

## Checking only pods

Problem:

Pods can be running but application may fail.

Example:

```text
Pod = Running

API = Failed
```

Solution:

Test application endpoints.

---

## Ignoring Kubernetes events

Events provide important information:

- Scheduling failures.
- Image pull problems.
- Configuration errors.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Kubernetes monitoring.
- Application health checks.
- Runtime troubleshooting.
- Logs and events.
- Production operations.

---

# Estimated Completion Time

Approximately 2 hours.

---

# Before Moving to Phase 18

Confirm:

- Health endpoint works.
- Logs are available.
- Kubernetes workloads are healthy.
- Monitoring verification is documented.

FlavorForge now has operational visibility.

# Phase 18 — Documentation Engineering and Automation

## Goal

Create a complete professional documentation system that captures the FlavorForge architecture, implementation process, verification results, troubleshooting procedures, and rebuild journey.

The objective is to ensure that the project can be understood and recreated by another developer after months or years.

---

# Why This Phase Comes Now

Software delivery is not complete when an application is deployed.

A production project requires documentation for:

- Knowledge transfer.
- Maintenance.
- Troubleshooting.
- Future development.
- Rebuilding environments.

Without documentation:

```text
Application works

but

Knowledge is lost
```

With documentation:

```text
Application

+

Engineering Knowledge

=

Maintainable System
```

---

# Concept

Imagine a machine built in a factory.

The machine alone is not enough.

The factory also needs:

- Design drawings.
- Operating instructions.
- Maintenance guide.
- Repair procedures.

Documentation provides the same purpose for software systems.

---

# Phase 19 — Demo Preparation and Presentation Engineering

## Goal

Prepare a complete technical demonstration workflow for presenting the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone.

The objective is to demonstrate:

- Application functionality.
- Cloud architecture.
- CI/CD automation.
- Kubernetes operations.
- GitOps deployment.
- Security practices.
- Troubleshooting capability.

---

# Why This Phase Comes Now

A production engineering project requires more than implementation.

Engineers must be able to explain:

- What was built.
- Why technologies were selected.
- How the system works.
- How failures are handled.

A good demonstration converts technical implementation into engineering communication.

---

# Concept

Imagine presenting a newly built aircraft.

Showing only the aircraft flying is not enough.

You should explain:

- Design.
- Engine.
- Safety systems.
- Failure handling.
- Maintenance process.

A DevOps demonstration follows the same principle.

---

# Common Mistakes

## Validating only the application

Problem:

Application works but deployment pipeline or infrastructure may fail.

Solution:

Validate the complete lifecycle.

---

## Skipping security validation

Problem:

Application may contain unresolved vulnerabilities.

Solution:

Verify SonarCloud and Trivy results.

---

## Not testing recovery

Problem:

Operational readiness is unknown.

Solution:

Verify:

- Kubernetes self-healing.
- GitOps synchronization.
- Rollback capability.

---

# Learning Outcome

After completing this phase, you understand:

- Production readiness validation.
- End-to-end DevSecOps verification.
- Application lifecycle review.
- Cloud deployment validation.

# Phase 23 — Final Engineering Review and Knowledge Transfer

## Goal

Perform a final engineering review of the FlavorForge Azure DevSecOps Capstone and ensure that the repository contains everything required for future developers to understand, rebuild, maintain, and extend the project.

The objective of this phase is to transfer complete technical knowledge of the system.

---

# Why This Phase Comes Last

The previous phases created:

- Application code.
- Cloud infrastructure.
- Container images.
- Kubernetes deployments.
- CI/CD automation.
- Security validation.
- GitOps workflow.
- Documentation.

However, a production engineering project also requires knowledge transfer.

A future developer should be able to answer:

```text
What was built?

How does it work?

Where are the important files?

How can it be rebuilt?

How can problems be diagnosed?
```

This phase confirms that all required information exists.
